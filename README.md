This is a clock application for Windows that also displays the system uptime. It's intended as a diagnostic tool to identify the instant freezes and other intermittent problems occur; because of this, power saving features like screen blanking are disabled while the clock is running.

The clock is a tiny (under 52 kB!) application with virtually no features, and I intend to keep it that way. It runs on Windows versions going at least as far back as NT 4.0 from 1996. The source code may be useful in its own right as a relatively straightforward example of Windows API programming.

You can download the latest version on the [releases page](https://github.com/bmjcode/uptime-clock/releases).
